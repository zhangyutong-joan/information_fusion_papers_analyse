Exploiting feature multi-correlations for multilabel feature selection in robust multi-neighborhood fuzzy Î² covering space
Multilabel data contains rich label semantic information,and its data structure conforms to the cognitive laws of the actual world.However,these data usually involve many irrelevant,redundant,and noisy features, challenging constructing effective learning models.It is necessary to design a feature selection strategy to select valid information in multilabel data. Generally,constructing a robust granular space is essential for building learning methods that can capture the intrinsic information contained in data.In addition,carefully investigating the complex relationship between features facilitates the evaluation of features.However,the interactivity and complementarity between features are rarely studied for multilabel data. Fuzzy B covering constructs granular space flexibly and excavates potential uncertainty information.The concept of fuzzy B covering theory is extended to multilabel data to reasonably construct the granular space of multilabel data and effectively quantify the uncertainty of multilabel data.Concretely,a parameterized multilabel fuzzy B covering relation is proposed to resist the negative effect of ambiguity,uncertainty,and noise in multilabel data,and a robust multi-neighborhood fuzzy B covering granular space is constructed. Besides,the concept of multilabel fuzzy B covering decision is explored to improve the accuracy and robustness of multilabel learning.The above concepts build the basis of multilabel fuzzy B covering uncertainty measures, and a series of fuzzy B covering entropy measures are then defined. Consequently,feature multi-correlations are presented,including relevance, redundancy,interactivity,and complementarity between features.Finally, following the principle of correlation maximization,a robust multilabel feature selection considering feature multi-correlations (RMSMC)is designed.Extensive experiments illustrate the superiority of RMSMC over nine representative algorithms.

Component similarity based conflict analysis:An information fusion viewpoint
Conflict is ubiquitous in social life.In many cases,conflict analysis based on single-valued information systems is no longer valid,such as TCM diagnosis. To this end,we model this problem as component similarity based conflict analysis.Specifically,we put forward a type of three-way n-valued concept lattices to handle set-valued formal contexts,based on which conflict analysis is performed by considering component similarity.What is more,a method from an information fusion viewpoint is proposed to realize fast conflict analysis.Finally,experimental results verify that the information fusion based conflict analysis method can greatly reduce time consumption in most occasions due to the fact that it produces less concepts with less time,and spends less time on visiting the concept space to determine the conflict states.This work will bring a novel idea to the component similarity based distributed big data analysis.

A hypergraph-based hybrid graph convolutional network for intracity human activity intensity prediction and geographic relationship interpretation
Human activity intensity prediction,i.e.,estimating the dynamic population distribution,is crucial to many location-based applications,particularly intelligent transportation systems and urban planning.Geographical artificial intelligence(GeoAl)is an emerging field that has contributed many new modeling approaches for spatiotemporal phenomena,especially spatiotemporal graph neural networks(ST-GNNs).However,there are two challenges to the prediction of human activity intensity.On the one hand, accurate predictions require modeling not only pairwise spatial relationships,e.g.,distance and spatial flow but also complex high-order relationships,such as clusters and groups.On the other hand,it is not appropriate to incorporate prior knowledge on the spatial structure of data with subjective assumptions using graphs with predefined topologies or weights.To mitigate such challenges,a novel deep learning-based model was proposed,namely,the Hypergraph-based Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network(HyGCN).In our study,high-order relationships are modeled by hypergraph convolutions,and pairwise relationships are captured in graph convolutions.A spatial fusion layer is added to fuse the pairwise and high- order relationships.Then,adaptive graph and hypergraph generation methods are proposed to interpret edge weights and understand the learned geographic relationships in accordance with principles.After systematic experiments on large-scale mobility data,our results demonstrate that HyGCN outperforms state-of-the-art models.The learned geospatial knowledge can be disentangled and explained from the perspectives of geographic principles.This study offers new insights for not only revisiting geographic laws in GeoAl but also utilizing spatiotemporal knowledge in deep learning models.

Traffic flow matrix-based graph neural network with attention mechanism for traffic flow prediction
Traffic flow forecasting is of great importance in intelligent transportation systems for congestion mitigation and intelligent traffic management.Most of the existing methods depend on deep learning to extract the spatial- temporal correlation of traffic nodes but ignore the traffic flow characteristics.In this paper,we design three traffic congestion indexes to reflect the operational status of nodes based on traffic flow theory and design a traffic flow matrix to better represent the relationship between nodes.We also design a novel graph convolution network with attention mechanisms called TFM-GCAM to better capture the spatial-temporal features and dynamic characteristics of nodes.A novel Fusion Attention mechanism is proposed to effectively fuse the dynamic characteristics and the spatial-temporal features for improvement.Experiments and ablation studies on the public dataset show the superiority of TFM-GCAM.We also discuss it with our previous works for a better understanding.Our research proposes to better integrate traffic flow theory into deep learning models and to better combine the respective strengths of attention mechanisms and graph neural networks for more effective traffic flow prediction.

Multivariate multiscale dispersion Lempel-Ziv complexity for fault diagnosis of machinery with multiple channels
Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC),as a nonlinear feature in information science, has shown great promise in detecting correlations and capturing dynamic changes in single-channel time series.However,its application to multichannel data has been largely unexplored,while the complexity of real- world systems demands the utilization of data collected from multiple sensors or channels so as to extract distinguishable fault features for fault diagnosis.This paper proposes a novel method called multivariate multiscale dispersion Lempel-Ziv complexity (mVMDLZC)to extract the fault features hidden in multi-source information.First,multivariate embedding theory is applied to obtain multivariate embedded vectors and multivariate dispersion patterns,which can reflect the inherent relationships in the multichannel series.Second,by assigning labels to these patterns,the original multichannel time series can be transformed into a symbolic sequence with multiple symbols instead of the original binary conversion,enabling the accurate recovery of the system dynamics.Finally,the complexity counter value and normalized LZC are calculated for the complexity measure. Experimental results using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that mvMDLZC outperforms existing LZC-based methods and multivariate dispersion entropy in recognizing different states of mechanical systems. Additionally,mvMDLZC exhibits robustness in handling challenges such as small sample datasets and noise interference,making it suitable for real industrial applications.These findings highlight the potential of mvMDLZC as a valuable approach for dissecting multichannel systems across various real- world scenarios.

Joint learning of data recovering and graph contrastive denoising for incomplete multi-view clustering
Incomplete multi-view clustering is pivotal in machine learning because complex systems are inherently difficult to be fully observed and therefore pose a great challenge to revealing the mechanisms and structure of underlying systems.Current methods are criticized for disregarding features with missing views or inadequately exploring the local structure within incomplete views.To solve these limitations,we propose a novel Unified Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for incomplete multi-view clustering (called UGCF),which jointly learns data restoration,graph contrastive denoising,and clustering.Specifically,UGCF first restores the missing values by exploiting the conserved relations in each view,and the local structure within data is preserved.Second,UGCF removes the heterogeneity of multi- view data by learning an affinity structure of objects for each view and constructs a unified graph for multi-view data by manipulating the topological structure of affinity graphs.To enhance the quality of the features of vertices,graph contrastive learning is executed on the unified graphs by selecting positive and negative samples,which considerably improves the discriminative of features,thereby eliminating noise in data.Finally,UGCF integrates data restoration,graph contrastive denoising,and clustering into an overall objective.Experiments demonstrate the superiority of UGCF over state-of-the-art baselines in incomplete multi-view clustering with various metrics.

Reciprocal transformer for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion
Hyperspectral and multispectral(HS-MS)image fusion aims to reconstruct high-resolution hyperspectral images from low-resolution hyperspectral images and high-resolution multispectral images.While convolutional neural networks have been widely used for HS-MS fusion,their potential is curtailed due to the limited receptive field of each neuron,resulting in inadequate long-range modeling capabilities.Although several Transformer- based HS-MS fusion methods have been proposed,most of them often fail to fully integrate and coordinate the data from the two modalities (i.e., hyperspectral images and multispectral images).Such ineffective interactions significantly compromise the quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral images.In this paper,we introduce a novel reciprocal fusion strategy called the dual cross Transformer-based fusion(DCTransformer)for HS-MS fusion.The model excels in capturing the interplay between different modalities by utilizing directional pairwise multi-head cross-attention, which facilitates the transfer of information between modalities. Additionally,we incorporate a Swin Transformer block post cross-attention to enhance the self-attention within the context.Extensive experiments show that our DCTransformer performs favorably against other recent works on both simulation HSI datasets and real HSI datasets.The source code and pre-trained models are availabe at https://github.com/qingma2016/DCTransformer.

Diffusion model with disentangled modulations for sharpening multispectral and hyperspectral images
The denoising diffusion model has received increasing attention in the field of image generation in recent years,thanks to its powerful generation capability.However,diffusion models should be deeply investigated in the field of multi-source image fusion,such as remote sensing pansharpening and multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion(MHIF).In this paper,we introduce a novel supervised diffusion model with two conditional modulation modules,specifically designed for the task of multi-source image fusion.These modules mainly consist of a coarse-grained style modulation (CSM)and a fine-grained wavelet modulation (FWM),which aim to disentangle coarse-grained style information and fine-grained frequency information,respectively,thereby generating competitive fused images. Moreover,some essential strategies for the training of the given diffusion model are well discussed,e.g.,the selection of training objectives.The superiority of the proposed method is verified compared with recent state- of-the-art (SOTA)techniques by extensive experiments on two multi-source image fusion benchmarks,i.e.,pansharpening and MHIF.In addition, sufficient discussions and ablation studies in the experiments are involved to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.The code is accessible at https://github.com/294coder/Dif-PAN for reproducibility purposes.

DFS-WR:A novel dual feature selection and weighting representation framework for classification
Classification methods relying on multidimensional features have been widely applied in commerce,healthcare,and transportation.Nevertheless, haphazardly selecting inappropriate features may not only hinder the improvement of classification performance but also disrupt the convergence of classifier parameters,leading to prolonged classifier runtime and an increased storage burden.Therefore,this paper proposed a novel framework (dubbed as DFS-WR)to perform dual selection and weighted representation of multidimensional features.Firstly,DFS-WR employs Laplacian scores to conduct a de-redundant operation as the first feature selection. Subsequently,DFS-WR utilizes a correlation coefficient matrix and redundant sorting to eliminate duplicate deployment of similar features in classification through the second selection.Finally,for hierarchical expression,DFS-WR assigns weights by virtue of information gain (IG) thereby emphasizing the significance of dominant features.The performance of DFS-WR was further evaluated across four aspects:classification ability, runtime performance,storage occupancy,and portability and universality, using five public datasets and eleven widely adopted classifiers.Additionally, this paper considered the proper configuration of crucial parameters within DFS-WR and compared it with other related works.The results indicated that the dual selection strategy for eliminating redundancy and similarities among features could improve the performance of classifiers,and the weighted process based on IG outperformed unweighted and ReliefF-based weighted methods.By employing DFS-WR to multidimensional features,the classifier's runtime and data storage capacity were effectively reduced.In addition,it was proved that the deployment of DFS-WR generally had no limitations on datasets and classifiers,underscoring its good portability and universality in practical applications.

Multivariate solar power time series forecasting using multilevel data fusion and deep neural networks
Accurate forecasting of regional solar photovoltaic power(SPVP)generation is essential for efficient energy management and planning.Existing approaches have shown the effectiveness of decomposing the time series to model the stochastic variability in SPVP data.However,these approaches have limitations in extracting and exploiting both spatial and temporal information from complex and high-dimensional data from multiple sources with intricate relationships,which can impact the accuracy of predictions.In this paper,we propose a novel approach called multilevel data fusion and neural basis expansion analysis (MF-NBEA)for forecasting aggregated regional-level SPVP generation.MF-NBEA integrates exogenous data at multiple levels,uses supervised and unsupervised encoders to provide compact data representation,and enhances model learning from complex data by incorporating spatial information.It also includes a sequence analyser module based on a neural network decomposition mechanism to learn the variability in data and incorporates a residuals learner module to improve overall predictions.We evaluate MF-NBEA using two real-world datasets and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of forecast accuracy.Furthermore,MF-NBEA facilitates information fusion and knowledge extraction to provide interpretable predictions regarding trend,seasonality,and residual components.The insights gained from our approach inform decision-making for energy management and planning,and can lead to more efficient and sustainable resource utilisation.

Sequential Fusion Filtering Based on Minimum Error Entropy Criterion
According to the minimum error entropy(MEE)criterion in information theory learning(ITL),the fusion filtering problem of non-Gaussian system is studied in this paper.Combined with the advantages of sequential fusion filtering (SFF)in dealing with asynchronous sampling and communication delay,two SFF algorithms are designed under MEE criterion.Firstly,the non- Gaussian multi-sensor system is transformed into a group of non-Gaussian single sensor subsystems.Then,by solving the optimal solution of the cost function corresponding to each subsystem,a set of fixed-point equations relating to the subsystems state is obtained.By using the strategies of global iteration and independent iteration to solve the fixed-point equations,two SFF algorithms based on the MEE criterion are designed,respectively.In addition,the performance including the computational complexity,the correlation between two iteration algorithms and their convergence is analyzed.Finally,simulation results indicate that the proposed SFF methods can effectively deal with the state estimation problem of non-Gaussian multi-sensor system,and can achieve similar fusion filtering accuracy.

Federated learning for loT devices: Enhancing TinyML with on-board training
The spread of the Internet of Things (IoT)involving an uncountable number of applications,combined with the rise of Machine Learning(ML),has enabled the rapid growth of pervasive and intelligent systems in a variety of domains,including healthcare,environment,railway transportation and Industry 4.0.While this opens up favorable scenarios,it also raises new challenges.The huge amount of data collected and processed by ML applications requires efficient and scalable solutions that contrast with the constrained capabilities of loT devices as for memory,power consumption, processing and network bandwidth.The TinyML technologies foster the adoption of ML algorithms running locally on IoT devices.However,they typically foresee a remote training process(e.g.,on cloud servers)combined with local inference-a strategy not always viable,e.g.,for privacy and security issues. We present a technique to enable the on-board training of ML algorithms on loT devices,through the combination of federated learning(FL)and transfer learning(TL).We experimentally analyze it in classification and regression problems,comparing it to traditional FL solutions,as well as with a consolidated technique based on Tensorflow Lite.Results show that FL with TL reaches accuracy values better than FL without TL in both classification (86.48%)and regression (0.0201).These results are comparable with a model trained on the full dataset.We further analyze training and inference time and power consumption on various devices.Finally,we evaluate how the performance changes with unbalanced training datasets,showing that although they strongly impact accuracy,FL makes models more robust, letting them achieve accuracy comparable to when trained on balanced datasets.

Spatial-temporal federated transfer learning with multi-sensor data fusion for cooperative positioning
With the development of advanced embedded and communication systems, location information has become a crucial factor in supporting context- aware or location-aware intelligent services.Among these services, intelligent transportation systems have the strictest requirements for real- time,accurate,and private location data.In this study,a Spatial-Temporal Federated Transfer Learning (ST-FTL)model is designed and introduced to achieve more accurate cooperative positioning by effectively utilizing spatial-temporal data in intelligent transportation systems(ITS).Specifically a three-layer FTL based framework is constructed to enhance location prediction accuracy while ensuring the privacy of acquired location data.The proposed federated learning(FL)approach considers,selects,and aggregates both spatial and temporal data attributes to improve prediction accuracy and achieve faster convergence.A multi-attribute based spatial-temporal clustering algorithm,along with convolutional gated units,is developed for efficient global model initialization and weight aggregation based on a newly designed transfer model that selects data from different regions in the spatial dimension.Additionally,a deep fusion based local training model is built to integrate data from various sensors and improve prediction accuracy.A lightweight Siamese network is employed to enhance data augmentation for insufficient GPS data in the temporal dimension,leading to improved prediction error.Experimental evaluations are conducted using the KITTI dataset,and the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior prediction accuracy and faster convergence compared to other state-of-the-art positioning methods.

QMFND:A quantum multimodal fusion-based fake news detection model for social media
Fake news is frequently disseminated through social media,which significantly impacts public perception and individual decision-making. Accurate identification of fake news on social media is usually time- consuming,laborious,and difficult.Although the leveraging of machine learning technologies can facilitate automated authenticity checks,the multimodal and voluminous nature of the data brings considerable challenge for fake news detection.To address the issue,this study firstly proposes an innovative quantum multimodal fusion-based fake news detection(QMFND) model.QMFND integrates the extracted images and textual features,thereby passing them through a quantum convolutional neural network(QCNN)to obtain discriminative results.By testing QMFND on two social media datasets,Gossip and Politifact,it is proved that its detection performance is equal to or even surpasses that of classical models.The effects of various parameters on the experimental results are further investigated.The QCNN circuit in QMFND not only has good expressibility and entangling capability but also has good robustness against quantum noise.

Distributed Filtering for Multi-Sensor Networked Systems with Stochastic Communication Protocol and Correlated noises
In multi-sensor networked systems,to solve data conflicts caused by limited bandwidths during measurement data exchange among sensors,a stochastic communication protocol scheduling is employed to ensure that each sensor can only receive one component of measurement vector from neighbor nodes at each instant.The measurement components selected for communication at each instant are indicated by a set of random variables. When each sensor knows which component of the measurement vector from each of its neighbor nodes is passed at each instant,an optimal distributed Kalman filter (ODKF)where both estimator and gain rely on values of random variables is designed in the linear minimum variance sense.To reduce the online computational burden,a suboptimal DKF(SDKF)where the filtering gain relies on probabilities of random variables is designed and its steady-state property is analyzed.When each sensor doesn't know which component of the measurement vector is passed at each instant,a probability-dependent DKF (PDKF)where both estimator and gain rely on probabilities of random variables is designed and its steady-state property is analyzed.Finally,the performances of the proposed three DKF algorithms are compared.Two simulation examples verify the effectiveness of algorithms.
